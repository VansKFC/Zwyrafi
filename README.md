# Zwyrafi
An in-depth refinement of Dying Light using [DLVK](https://www.github.com/VansKFC/DLVK) as a base.

## Zwyrafi is originally a mod designed to improve performance, reliability, and convenience in [Dying Light](https://dyinglightgame.com/dyinglight/).
Zwyrafi now is a fork of [Dying Light Vulkan](https://www.github.com/VansKFC/DLVK) which has the same goal as before but will be easier to manage with significantly higher quality.

### The use of Zwyrafi for cheating, hacking, and gaining and unfair advantage are not tolerated and is not the goal of this project.
